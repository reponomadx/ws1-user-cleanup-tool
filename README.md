A fully modular PowerShell-based toolset to identify, review, and clean up **inactive Workspace ONE users** and their **device enrollments** across Active Directory and Workspace ONE UEM.

---

## üè∑Ô∏è Why This Tool Exists

Many organizations use multiple Active Directory (AD) groups to manage Workspace ONE user enrollments based on device type, ownership model, or feature access. A common example is maintaining **separate enrollment groups** for **corporate-owned devices with limited messaging capabilities** versus standard users. 

Over time, these groups can become cluttered with:
- **Disabled user accounts**
- **Stale or inactive enrollments**
- **Duplicate memberships between groups**

This toolset was developed to streamline **regular auditing and cleanup** of these enrollment groups, ensuring:
- AD group memberships stay accurate,
- Workspace ONE enrollment records remain current,
- And administrative overhead is reduced through automation.

It‚Äôs built for environments where **clean enrollment groups lead to smoother provisioning**, reduced licensing waste, and better operational control.

---

## üìÇ Tool Structure

This solution consists of four coordinated scripts:

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `WS1_User_Cleanup.ps1` | Compares two AD groups, identifies disabled accounts, and finds users in both groups. |
| `WS1_Device_Info.ps1` | Queries Workspace ONE for enrollment status based on AD results using OAuth. |
| `WS1_Device_Profiles.ps1` | Queries Workspace ONE for assigned device profiles based on device ID results. |
| `Remove_From_AD_Group.ps1` | Removes disabled users from their respective AD groups using the processed CSV files. |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- **PowerShell 5.1+**
- **RSAT: ActiveDirectory module**
- **Workspace ONE API client** (OAuth 2.0 `client_id` and `client_secret`)
- Access to Workspace ONE UEM API (e.g., `https://your-env.awmdm.com/api`)
- CSV files generated from the tool‚Äôs step-by-step usage

---

## üîê OAuth Configuration

To use the tool, populate the following values inside the **Workspace ONE API scripts**:

```powershell
$clientId     = "<Your_Client_ID>"
$clientSecret = "<Your_Client_Secret>"
$ws1EnvUrl    = "<Your_Environment_URL>/API"
$tokenUrl     = "<Your_Token_Endpoint>"
```

These values should **only be stored in secured, admin-only environments**.  
Do **not commit secrets** to GitHub.
